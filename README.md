　　历史留给以色列人的不是古老和辉煌，只是零散与辛酸。在这段饱经沧桑的历史中，以色列人得到的唯一财富就是自强不息的奋斗精神，这种精神能量的积累和爆发是推动以色列经济迅速崛起的原动力。
　　因为住楼房，女儿又小，上下楼自然不太方便。所以我只能抱着女儿上楼、背着女儿下楼，经常跟女儿边走楼梯边说话。有一次我出门，又背着女儿下楼，感觉有些累时就跟她讲：“等你再长大点儿，要自己走路，不能让妈妈背了”。没想到女儿随口就说：“妈妈，等你老了，我也要背你下楼”。一个两岁多的孩子能说出这样的话，当时我听了感觉是那么惊喜和心慰，仿佛所有的辛苦和倦乏全部一扫而空，留在心里的只是甜蜜和幸福。就为了这一句话，就算我付出的再多，也心甘情愿、无怨无悔。
生存往往让人莫衷一是，当你心力枯槁的功夫，就不如把手形成一把钢刀，一刀两断，让十足变得杂乱无章，让生存回归大略的实质，当你走到此岸回顾望向往日的体验，就会恍然领会，能做到断舍离才是运气的强人。

As for me, also is not the real citizens, in tianshui, I only know that can take bus to the railway station, take bus 2 to tianshui teachers college, go to other place I'd rather take a taxi, bike or on foot, because I really don't know where they come from, how to go to.
Now I stand outside the Beijing's xizhimen, thinking about the bus and accent can tell a person's identity, you heart, no matter how, I was the guest of every city.
